# Introduction

Welcome to FINA 6333 for Spring 2023!

## Website

I will maintain all our notebooks on this website because Canvas does not render notebooks.
This website to renders our notebooks and offers several other ways to interact:

1. Download them by clicking on the down arrow in the upper-right corner of each page
1. Run them in an *ad hoc* JupyterLab server by clicking on the three rings in the in the upper-right corner of each page
1. Vist the course repository by clicking on the ... in the in the upper-right corner of each page

## How We Will Use These Notebooks

Each course topic has one notebook for the lecture and one notebook for the practice exercises.
I plan to "flip the classroom" this semester, which means:

1. Each week, I will record a short, focused lecture based on the lecture notebook
1. Before class, you will watch this short, focused lecture, review the lecture notebook, and read the textbook
1. During class, we will work through the practice exercise notebook together
1. After class, I will update these notebooks, and you will complete DataCamp courses, quizzes, and projects to reinforce what we learn

I will maintain these notebooks on this website but everything else on Canvas (and Gradescope). 


## GitLab

This GitLab repository generates this website: <https://gitlab.com/dmsb-fina-6333/2023-spring>
If GitLab intimidates you, you can ignore the GitLab repository and download our notebooks one by one, as I describe above in option 1.
If GitLa does not intimidate you, you can use this repository in a few ways:

1. Fork it to create your own copy of our notebooks that you can upadte throughout the semester
1. Create issues to help me improve our notebooks

## How to Run JupyterLab

I suggest you run JupyterLab on Research Computing's Open OnDemand service: <https://ood.disocvery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/>.
This service is fast, reliable, and can access a shared folder with course notebooks.
You can log in with your Northeastern username and password, and you can start a JupyterLab session under "My Interactive Sessions".

You can also install Anaconda on your laptop to run JupyterLab (I am happy to help you during office hours) or use DataCamp Workspaces.
